    My name is Rebecca Wirick. I am in my fourth year at Boise State and have one more year after this one. 
    I changed my major to GIMM last year from computer science and have been enjoying it ever since. 
    I was born and raised outside of Ft. Worth, Texas and moved to Boise to come to school. On campus I am involved in 
    The student IMPACT Board as the VP of Marketing so I plan on using the skills I learn this semester in WebDev to create a website for 
the organization. I currently work at The Discovery Center of Idaho and really like the opportunity that 
I have through my job get kids excited about STEM opportunities. Outside of school and work, I love to ski, hike, and watch football 
with friends. I am unsure about my plans after graduation, but I think developing the technology we study into educational use, 
whether it be in classrooms or training simulations is something I am interested in. </div>
